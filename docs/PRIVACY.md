# Privacy

Effective 14 October 2026 (Selis 1.0). Selis is developed by Any WeCon.

Selis collects nothing: no account, no analytics, no crash reporting, no advertising, no
identifiers sent anywhere. Your library stays in the app's private storage on your device.

## Network use

Selis opens **no** network connection at startup or while you read and edit. The only part
that uses the network is **Transfer** (device to device), and only while the Transfer screen is
open — or while a transfer you started is still running (Android shows a notification then).

When you send or receive documents:

- The two devices connect **directly** when they can (same Wi‑Fi, or across networks by QUIC
  hole punching). Documents are end-to-end encrypted (QUIC with TLS 1.3); both screens show the
  same 6-digit code, which the sender confirms before anything is sent.
- If no direct path works, the encrypted traffic goes through a **relay**. By default that is a
  public relay run by n0 (the makers of iroh), and n0's address-lookup service (DNS/pkarr) is
  used to find the other device. The relay and the lookup service **see your IP address** and
  the other device's public key during the transfer; they **cannot read** the documents.
- **Settings › Transfer › Local network only** turns the relay and the address lookup off:
  devices find each other on the same Wi‑Fi (mDNS) only.
- **Settings › Transfer › Relay** lets you use your own relay (`iroh-relay`) instead of n0's;
  then no n0 server is contacted at all.

The QR code / link contains your device's network addresses (local and public IP, relay), the
documents' content hash and a one-time code valid for 10 minutes. Share it only with the device
you are sending to.

## Trusted devices and library move

- A device you save after a transfer is stored as a name and its public key, on this device
  only. It can then send here without QR code — but only while your Receive tab is open — and
  sends to it skip the code. Remove it at any time (× next to it); it takes effect at once.
- Moving your library sends your documents, versions, tags, favorites, signatures and settings
  to your other device, end-to-end encrypted, as any transfer. Your device key is not moved.

## Selis pack files (.selispack)

- **Save as file** (Send tab) writes the chosen documents, or the whole library, into one
  `.selispack` file and hands it to the app you pick in the share sheet (USB, e-mail, your own
  cloud). Selis uses no network for this; where the file goes is your choice.
- Without a passphrase the file is **not encrypted**: anyone who has it can read the documents.
  With a passphrase it is encrypted (Argon2id + XChaCha20-Poly1305, ADR 0012); the passphrase is
  never stored, and without it the file cannot be opened — there is no recovery.
- A whole-library file also carries your tags, favorites, signatures and settings, never your
  device key or trusted devices.
- On Android the file stays in the app's private cache (the share folder) so the receiving app
  can read it after the share sheet closes. Selis deletes every pack there **the next time it
  starts and before every new export** — an unencrypted pack never outlives the next start of
  the app. Elsewhere (desktop) the file is written only where you save it; the working copy in
  the cache is deleted right after. Opening a pack reads a private copy, which is deleted right
  after.

## Device identity

Each device has its own key (Ed25519), made on the device and kept in the system's secure
storage (Android Keystore, iOS / macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager). It never leaves
the device, is not backed up and is not part of a library move.

## Text recognition (OCR)

"Make text searchable" reads scanned pages on the device (Tesseract, bundled with the app with
its Greek and English models). Nothing is downloaded or sent; the recognised words are stored
only in the new version of your document, as invisible text.

## Photos

"Images to PDF" opens the system photo picker: Selis sees only the photos you pick, never your
whole gallery, and needs no storage permission. Photo details such as location and camera
(EXIF) are removed from the PDF it makes. "Save page as image" hands a page to the share sheet; on
iOS, "Save Image" there asks for permission to add it to your photos.

## Camera and notifications

- The camera is used only when you tap "Scan QR code" on the Receive tab, to read the transfer
  code, and while the Scan screen is open, to photograph pages. Frames are processed on the
  device and never sent. A scanned page is kept only if you tap Keep, and only as part of the
  PDF you save (no photo details such as location are in it); the camera stops when you leave
  the screen or the app.
- Android: a notification shows the progress of a running transfer (you can refuse the
  notification permission; the transfer still runs).

## Permissions (Android)

| Permission | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Internet, network state | Transfer, only while it is in use |
| Wi‑Fi multicast | Find your other device on the same Wi‑Fi (mDNS) |
| Camera | Scan a transfer QR code or a document (asked the first time you use either) |
| Foreground service (data sync), notifications | Keep a running transfer going in the background, show its progress |

## Permissions (iOS)

| Permission | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Local network | Find your other device on the same Wi‑Fi (Bonjour), only while Transfer is open |
| Camera | Scan a transfer QR code or a document |
| Add to photos | Only if you choose "Save Image" for a page you export |
